## Bringing Your Own Georeferenced Point Data into QGIS
This exercise will show you how to bring your own georeferenced data into QGIS so that you can map it. In particular, you will:

- Create a point data file from X,Y coordinates.
- Calculate the number of fire stations in each region using a combination of geoprocessing functions.

The data in this exercise consists of the geographic location of fire stations in West Yorkshire. Originally, only the fire station addresses were known. If you have addresses, you can look up the postcode in a postcode reference file and obtain an X,Y coordinate, which is essentially the centre of that postcode. Alternatively, you might manually record coordinates using a GPS, which you then want to plot.

### Create a Point Shapefile from X,Y coordinates
1. Navigate to the Exercise6 folder and open the file called `Firestations.xls` in Excel. This file contains the X,Y coordinates for the locations of the fire stations along with some other data about these stations. The Easting and Northing are the X and the Y respectively, where the terms Easting and Northing are specific to the British National Grid system. However, you can do this in the same way for any set of coordinates and any reference system (latitude and longitude for example).

2. QGIS can read text delimited files but not Excel so save the file as comma separated values (CSV Comma delimited). Close Excel.

3. Close QGIS if it is still open and restart it.

4. From the main menu select Layer > Add Delimited Text Layer. If you cannot find this option, then you will need to add the plugin for this feature. To do this, select Plugins > Manage Plugins… and choose **Add Delimited Text Layer**.

5. You will see a screen like that shown below. Here are things to note:

  - File Name – browse to find the CSV file on your computer so the actual path will be different than the one shown in the figure

  - The Layer name will be Firestations but you can modify this if you wish


  - The file format is CSV (comma separated values) but you can also use files delimited by other characters such as tabs or semi-colons. However, CSV is one of the most common formats.
  
  - QGIS has already recognised that the first row contains the names of the fields, which is why this box will be checked already. If it’s not, please check it.
  
  - QGIS has also recognised that the file contains point coordinates and it needs to know which column contains the X coordinate and which contains the Y coordinate. In this case the X is the Easting and the Y is the Northing. These are very specific to the British National Grid but you can imagine having latitude and longitude in two columns and having to assign these to the X Y fields. Thus you may need to adjust these yourself for your own files.

6. Click OK and the fire stations will plot (if you cannot see then right click and zoom to layer).

7. Right click on the Firestations layer in the Layers panel and select Set Layer CRS. Choose OSGB 1936 / British National Grid and press OK.

8. Right now the points are not saved so right click on Firestations and select Save as… There are lots of different formats available but keep this as ESRI Shapefile. Enter a name for the shapefile, clicking the Browse button to select where this will be saved. Click OK.

9. Remove Firestations from the list (right click on the name and select remove) and load the new shapefile you just created in step 8.

10. Open the attribute table. What kinds of data are associated with each fire station?

11. Create a new column and calculate the % of total incidents that were fires. Create a second column and calculate the % of false alarms. Which stations have the highest and lowest number of fire incidents? Which stations have the highest and lowest number of false alarms?

###  Running a Dissolve and Point in Polygon
Suppose you create a point shapefile from the data you have collected. You might then want to know how many points fall in a particular region. To illustrate how this works, let’s calculate how many fire stations fall within each district in West Yorkshire.

1. Load the wyorkmap shapefile from the Exercise2 folder and set the CRS to OSGB 1936 . This file contains wards and not districts so let’s dissolve the boundaries to create a district shapefile.

2. You need to indicate a field on which to dissolve the boundaries or the Dissolve field. This is the field that contains the district name or a unique code. In this case, the boundaries contain census codes. Open the attribute table for wyorkmap and you will see a field called **DIST**. This is the 4 character census code for the district. Select Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Dissolve from the main menu and choose **DIST as the Dissolve field**. Indicate a shapefile name and run the operation, loading this new map into QGIS. Check the CRS is still OSGB 1936.

3. Choose Vector > Analysis Tools > Points in polygon from the main menu.

4. QGIS will automatically detect which layer is the polygon file and which holds the points. Make sure these are correct and then to browse to a folder and give your new shapefile a name such as `FireStationNumbers.shp`.

5. Click OK and add the new layer to QGIS.

6. Open the attribute table of the new shapefile and the number of fire stations will appear in the column labelled **PNTCNT**. Which district has the most fire stations?

7. Although this was for illustration purposes only, you can see how this might be useful if you have many points across various regions of interest. Can you think of an example where you might have a point dataset that you would like to map and then count the number in a particular area?
