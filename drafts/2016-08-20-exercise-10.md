## Working with Raster Data in QGIS
In this exercise you will:
- Display a raster and examine the properties
- Add a hillshade effect and contours
- Calculate slope and aspect
- Reclassify data
- Use the raster calculator.


### Display a Raster and Examine the Properties
1. You will load a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), which you can find in the Exercise10 folder. The file is called `dem30.asc` and is an ASCII file containing a raster.

2. Click on the Add Raster Layer icon ![alt text](/img/fig10-1.png) and browse to find this file. Click Open to load it.

3. Right click on the dem30 layer and select Set Layer CRS.

4. In the Filter box, enter: NAD27 / UTM zone 12N. Press OK. This is an example where the projection information was known but was NOT saved with the raster file so we need to tell QGIS what the projection is. If you want to know more about this projection, check out this page: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system>

5. Double click on the dem30 layer and select the Metadata tab. Scroll through the information. What is the resolution of the DEM in meters? What is the average elevation? What is the maximum elevation? How many cells or pixels are there in the DEM? (Hint: these are not tricky questions so ask for help if you need it).

###  Add a Hillshade Effect and Contours
1. Now add a hillshade effect by selecting Raster > Analysis > DEM (Terrain Models). Give the output layer a name and leave the other options as they are. Right click on the layer, select Set Layer CRS and set it to NAD27 / UTM zone 12N. What immediately shows up in the DEM that was not visible before?

2. Now add contours to the DEM by selecting Raster > Extraction > Contour. Make sure the input raster is dem30, provide a name for the contour shapefile that will be produced and change the interval to 100.0 metres. Click OK and then set the layer CRS like in previous steps. The contours should now plot on top of the DEM (Hint: turn off the hillshade map or move it below the dem30 layer).


### Calculate Slope and Aspect from the DEM
1. The slope is the maximum rate of change in elevation between a cell and its eight neighbouring cells, usually expressed in degrees. The steeper the slope, the higher this value will be. Aspect is the steepest downslope direction between a cell and each of its eight neighbouring cells. You can think of it as the direction of the slope. It is measured clockwise where 0 is north, 90 degrees is east, 180 degrees is south-facing and 270 degrees is west. Select Raster > Analysis > DEM (Terrain Models) and change the mode to Slope. Use the dem30 to create the slope and then set the layer CRS to NAD27 / UTM zone 12N.

2. What is the maximum slope value in this area? What is the average slope?

3. Now calculate the aspect using the same window but this time choose Aspect. Use the dem30 as the input layer. Set the layer CRS to NAD27 / UTM zone 12N. What is the predominant aspect?

###  Reclassify Data
1. Reclassifying data involves assigning new values to old ones in a raster. Suppose you need to identify areas of low, medium and high slopes for building purposes. You will assign new values of 1 (low), 2 (medium) and 3 (high) to the slope grid, where low is < 5 degrees, medium is 5 to 10 degrees and anything greater than 10 degrees is high. Reclassify is useful if you want to identify thresholds in the data rather than working with continuous data.

2. There is currently no function built directly into QGIS for doing this so we will access the GRASS software directly through QGIS. In order to do the reclass, a text file must be created which maps the original values to the new values. A file called `reclass.txt` can be found in the Exercise10 folder. Find this file in Windows File Explorer and open it using Notepad.

3. There are three lines to the text file which map the values of the slopes to the categories 1, 2 and 3, as outlined in step D1. Close this file once you have understood what is contained in this file.

4. To access GRASS commands, click on Processing > Toolbox from the main menu. A new window will appear on the side. Open up Grass Commands > Raster and find a command called r.reclass. Double click on it to open the screen:

5. Make sure the input raster is the grid you want to reclassify, i.e. the slope grid and browse for the file containing reclass rules, i.e. reclass.txt. Leave the rest of the screen as is and click Run. One the new reclassed raster is loaded, change the Style of the raster to use Singleband pseudocolor with 3 bands. (Hint: change the mode to equal interval and then select 3 classes and classify).

### Use the Raster Calculator
1. To bring up the Raster Calculator, select Raster > Raster Calculator from the main menu.
2. Try a simple calculation whereby you standardise the DEM to values between 0 and 1. You might need to do this in situations where you compare more than one raster and you want them all to be on the same scale. Standardising involves using the expression below to standardise the values between 0 and 1:
(Grid - Min) / (Max - Min)

3. Check that the newly standardised raster has values between 0 and 1 (or near enough) via the Properties window.

4. Now letâ€™s consider another different problem. Suppose we want to identify areas that might be suitable for agriculture. At the moment all we have is slope and aspect. The criteria for initially choosing areas will be a low slope (i.e. less than 5 degrees) and areas that are largely south- facing, so southeast, south and southwest. Reclassify the slope grid such that 0 are areas of slope greater than 5 and 1 is areas less than 5. Do the same for aspect, i.e. 1 is areas of southeast, south and southwest aspect while 0 is all other areas. Now think about how you would combine these two grids in the raster calculator so that they show areas of both low slope and a favourable aspect with values ranging between 0 and 1.
