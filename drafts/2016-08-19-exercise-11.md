title: Exercise 11  - Data Discovery

## Data Discovery
One of the most frequently asked questions when working with a GIS is: where can I find some data? In this exercise you will:

- Learn how to find spatial data
- Load data using a Web Map Service (WMS)
- Load data using a Web Feature Service (WFS).

### Finding Spatial Data
In Exercise 9, you used some data from OpenStreetMap as a base map for digitising some features. You may have noticed that there are several other base maps available including aerial photos and satellite imagery. Although you cannot actually do any analysis with the data, you can use it as a reference on which to display your own data or for future digitising exercises. There are many other sources of data available, which we could divide into three types:

- Data in a GIS format that you find and download to your own computer so that you can actually work with the data and do spatial analysis.

- Data imported to the GIS via a Web Map Service (WMS). It is not possible to do spatial analyses on data imported this way.

- Data imported to the GIS via a Web Feature Service (WFS) or Web Coverage Service (WCS), which allows you to directly ingest GIS data into QGIS without having to download it to your hard disk. WFS are for vector data and WCS are for raster data. Unlike ii., you can treat the data just like shapefiles and raster files on your local disk, creating maps and doing spatial analysis.

#### Let’s look for examples of data in all three categories:
1. If you need some vector data as a shapefile, one of the easiest things to do is simply search for this using Google. Try this now. Open a browser, go to the Google search engine and search on ‘shapefiles’. You will find sites that offer free shapefiles for different features. Try downloading one and load it into QGIS.

2. Data can also be found using dedicated geospatial portals. Here are some examples:

	- the GEO Access and Discovery broker: <http://www.eurogeoss-broker.eu/>
	- FAO’s GeoNetwork: <http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home/>
	- Many geo data clearing warehouses (search in Google and you will find many)
	- ESRI’s open data portal: <https://opendata.arcgis.com/>
	- The UK Ordnance Survey open data portal: <http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendata/>
	
	Have a look at some of these, especially if you are looking for some specific datasets for your research, teaching or work in general.

3. To find WMS, WFS and WCS, there are a number of websites available:
	- the Spatineo directory: <http://www.spatineo.com/>
	- Skylab’s OGC WMS Server list: <http://www.skylab-mobilesystems.com/en/wms_serverlist.html/>
	- the INSPIRE portal from the EU: <http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/discovery/>
	- GEOPOLE: <http://geopole.org/>
	
### Loading Data from a WMS
Let’s now try to load some data from a WMS into QGIS. The good thing is that you can actually search for WMS directly within QGIS.

1. Clear any previous layers you may have been using.

2. Click on the Add WMS/WMTS Layer icon (or choose this from the Layer menu).

3. Click on the tab Server Search.

4. Enter UK or another area of interest and press the Search button.

5. The search should yield a series of data that you can access via WMS. Click and highlight one that looks interesting and click on the Add selected row to WMS list button at the bottom of the window.

6. Change to the Layers tab and hit the Connect button. This should load the data in the window beneath. [Note: If you get an error message (because the WMS cannot be found), go back to the Server Search tab and select another dataset]. If the dataset contains a large amount of features, we recommend selecting one dataset in the data window and clicking Add at the bottom of the window. It may take a while for the data to appear in the map window – be patient!

7. One loaded, double click on the data layer in the Layers Panel to bring up the Layer Properties window and select Metadata. This should provide you with more information about the layer.

### Loading Data from a WFS
Now let’s try loading some data from a WFS. You may want to remove / hide the previous WMS layer to reduce processing time. It’s not possible to search for WFS from QGIS so we are going to use an external site to find WFS datasets.

1. Click on the Add WFS Layer icon (or choose this from the Layer menu).

2. Click on the New button.

3. Enter `nsidc.org` in the Name field.

4. Enter `http://nsidc.org/cgi-bin/atlas_south?version=1.1.0` in the URL field and press OK.

5. Click on the Connect button in the original window and a list of different datasets available by WFS will be listed. Be patient as this may take some time. Choose one dataset and click the Add button.

6. The file you add can now be used in further GIS analyses. For example, open the attribute table and examine what data are contained with this vector file. Try to create a shaded map or change the symbology, if appropriate for the data you loaded.

	Note: if that WFS did not work (i.e. the service was down), try one from below:
