## An Introduction to Editing in QGIS

#### This part of the course is optional

In this exercise you will:

- Load a basemap
- Create a new polygon shapefile so that you can enter new data
- Create and edit polygons
- Simplify a polygon
- Digitise some polygons and points.

### Load a Basemap
1. Close QGIS if open and restart it.

2. From the main menu, select Plugins> Manage and Install Plugins.

3. Select the OpenLayers Plugin and click the Install Plugin button. Close this window. Note: You only need to do this once and the plugin will remain installed.

4. Select Web > OpenLayers plugin and note all the different layers that are available. Choose OpenStreetMap.

5. Zoom into the UK and progressively into the city of Leeds, and find the University of Leeds. Zoom down far enough so that you can clearly see buildings and other features. We will digitise some of these features.


### Create a New Polygon Shapefile
1. To create a new shapefile, click on the New Shapefile Layer button: ![alt text](/img/fig9-1.png)
(or select Layer > New > New Shapefile Layer from the main menu). Choose Polygon, leave the projection as WGS84, add the words Feature to the Name box, make sure that the Type is Text data and click on the Add to attributes list. Click OK.

2. You will be prompted to add a name for your shapefile. Choose a name (e.g. LeedsUniversity), create a new folder called Exercise9 and and save the new shapefile there.


### Start an Editing Session and Digitise a Polygon
1. To start editing, click on the Toggle editing mode button: ![alt text](/img/fig9-2.png) If you cannot see the whole editor toolbar, just drag it to another place on the screen and it will expand:

2. Select Settings > Snapping Options to 0.0001. Check the other two options in this window. This will close polygons for you when you have not clicked on the exact point where you started.

3. Find a feature that you want to digitize, e.g. a building. Click on the Add Feature button ![alt text](/img/fig9-4.png), click on one corner of the building and then systematically click on the other corners. This willdraw the polygon. When you come back to the first corner to close the polygon, simply right click on the node. This will close the polygon and prompt you to enter an ID number and Feature name. Enter appropriate values.

### Move the Polygon/Add other Vertices
1. From the Editor toolbar, click on the Move Feature(s) button ![alt text](/img/fig9-5.png). Select the polygon that you just drew and move it around as you wish.

2. Click on the Node Tool ![alt text](/img/fig9-6.png). Now double click in the middle of a straight segment of any polygon. This will insert a new node. Try dragging this and moving it around.

3. To save your changes, click on the Toggle Editing button and exit out of editing mode at the same time or use the button to the right to save your changes as you edit.

4. To delete a polygon (when editing mode is on), click on the Select Single Feature icon ![alt text](/img/fig9-7.png)
and and press the delete button: ![alt text](/img/fig9-8.png).

### Simplify a Feature
1. Create a new polygon with at least 20 vertices and make sure that some of these are quite close together.

2. Select Edit > Simplify Feature from the main menu the Simplify Feature button ![alt text](/img/fig9-9.png)
(hint: this is on the Advanced Digitizing toolbar which you would need to enable) and use the slider bar to remove vertices and simplify the polygon. There are also other buttons on this advanced editing toolbar that you could try out if you wish.

### Digitise a Set of Polygons and Points
You are now ready to digitise a set of polygons and points!

1. Digitise some more of the polygon features from the university, e.g. green spaces, buildings with names, etc. until you are happy that you are able to do this. 

2. If you want to keep going, create a new point shapefile and digitise a set of points, e.g. points of interest such as restaurants, hotels, etc.
